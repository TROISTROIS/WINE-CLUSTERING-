**THE ELBOW METHOD**\n","Using an arbitrary value of k results in 50 clusters which does not do much. I am going to use the elbow method to find k then perform clustering. In the Elbow method, we are actually varying the number of clusters ( K ) from 1 – 10. For each value of K, we are calculating WCSS ( Within-Cluster Sum of Square ). WCSS is the sum of squared distance between each point and the centroid in a cluster. When we plot the WCSS with the K value, the plot looks like an Elbow. As the number of clusters increases, the WCSS value will start to decrease. WCSS value is largest when K = 1. When we analyze the graph we can see that the graph will rapidly change at a point and thus creating an elbow shape. From this point, the graph starts to move almost parallel to the X-axis. The K value corresponding to this point is the optimal K value or an optimal number of clusters."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"id":"ee7d8b84","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-08T05:53:21.142538Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-08T05:53:21.142237Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-08T05:53:21.148347Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-08T05:53:21.147032Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.019804,"end_time":"2022-12-08T05:53:21.149987","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-08T05:53:21.130183","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["def
